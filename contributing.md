# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/anomalylabs/lexicon).


## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** 
\- The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests. Unit test written with PHPSpec since 
everything else has been unit tested with it..

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure documentation is kept up-to-date.

- **Create topic branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make 
multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.


## Running Tests

```language-php
$ phpspec run
```

**Happy coding**!
